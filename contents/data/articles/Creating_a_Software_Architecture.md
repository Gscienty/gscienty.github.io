#Creating a Software Architecture#
----------------------------------
The first concern of a software archiecture is not the functionality of the system.

One role of the architect is to ensure that the design of the system will meet the needs of the client, and we use quality concerns to help us understand those needs.  
two key practices of successful architects: stakeholder involvement and a focus on both quality concerns and functionality.  
Typical stakeholders and their concerns include:

+ Funders, who want to know if the project can be completed within resource and schedule constraints.
+ Archiects, developers, and testers, who are first concerned with initial construction and later with maintenance and evolution.
+ Project managers, who need to organize teams and plan iterations.
+ Marketers, who may want to use quality concerns to differentiate the system from competitors.
+ Users, including end users, system administrators, and the people who do installation, deployment, provisioning, and configuration
+ Technical support staff, who are concerned with the number and complexity of Help Desk calls.

important concerns: changeability, maintainability, usability.
